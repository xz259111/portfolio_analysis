Project README
Overview
This project consists of two main components designed for portfolio analysis and report generation in Python. The first script, Portfolio_analysis_Ziyuan_Zhou.py, is responsible for loading, analyzing, and calculating returns for various investment strategies. The second script, Excel_report.py, focuses on exporting the analyzed data into a structured Excel report. Together, these tools offer a comprehensive approach to portfolio management and analysis.

Portfolio_analysis_Ziyuan_Zhou.py
Description
The Portfolio_analysis_Ziyuan_Zhou.py script is designed to perform data loading and analysis for portfolio management. It calculates the returns for each investment strategy based on profit and loss (P&L) and allocated capital. Moreover, it analyzes the return concentration for the top N strategies, providing insights into portfolio performance and strategy effectiveness.

Key Features
Data Loading: Import data from various sources for analysis.
Return Calculation: Compute strategy returns from P&L and allocated capital.
Analysis: Analyze return concentration among top-performing strategies.
Usage
To use this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with necessary libraries such as pandas for data manipulation. The script can be executed from the command line or integrated into larger Python projects for portfolio analysis.

Excel_report.py
Description
The Excel_report.py script exports analyzed data to an Excel file, making use of the pandas library for data manipulation and the Excel export functionality. It is designed with modularity and maintenance in mind, allowing for easy integration into other applications.

Key Features
Modular Design: Separated class and function for exporting data to Excel, enhancing code reusability and maintenance.
Easy Integration: Designed to be easily integrated with other parts of applications or standalone scripts.
Usage
Before running this script, ensure pandas is installed. The script can be executed independently or called from other Python scripts to generate Excel reports based on analyzed portfolio data.
